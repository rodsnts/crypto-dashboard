# Considerations

I had a blast working on this project! I got so into it that I ended up adding more features than what was originally asked for XD. I made sure to implement all the required features, and in some cases, I used different methods to achieve the same result—just to showcase as much of my knowledge as possible (for example, data fetching in a Server Component vs. a Client Component). Plus, I took the chance to learn a bit more about Tailwind CSS. While it’s not my first time using it (I've dabbled before), this was the first time I really focused on making things look clean and polished.

I hope the reviewer enjoys checking out my solution as much as I enjoyed putting it together :D
